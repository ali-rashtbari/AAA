- **MongoDB** is an open source NOSQL dataset in C++, this offers flexible data models, indexing, replication and modern applications for scalable architecture.
- Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table.
- Collections do not enforce a schema.
- A document is a set of key-value pairs.
- Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic. 
- _**_id** is a 12 bytes hexadecimal number which assures the uniqueness of every document. You can provide _id while inserting the document.

These 12 bytes first 4 bytes for the current timestamp, next 3 bytes for machine id, next 2 bytes for process id of MongoDB server and remaining 3 bytes are simple incremental VALUE.

## Advantages
